# TOM Registration

This reusable TOM Toolkit app provides support for two user registration flows in the TOM Toolkit.

The two registration flows are as follows:

 1. Open Registration - In this flow, the user fills in a registration form and is immediately able to access the TOM as a member of the Public Group.

 2. Approval Registration - In this flow, the user fills in a registration form, and is inactive until an administrator reviews and approves their registration.

## Installation

 1. Install the package into your TOM environment:
   ```bash
   pip install tom_registration
   ```

 2. In your project `settings.py`, add `tom_registration` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` setting:

    ```python
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        'tom_registration',
    ]
    ```

    And add the follow setting, with appropriate values for your use case:

    ```python
    TOM_REGISTRATION = {
        'REGISTRATION_AUTHENTICATION_BACKEND': 'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',
        'REGISTRATION_REDIRECT_PATTERN': 'home',
        'SEND_APPROVAL_EMAILS': True,
        'REGISTRATION_STRATEGY': 'open' #['open', 'approval_required']
    }
    ```

    To prevent logged-in users from accessing the registration page, add `RedirectAuthenticatedUsersFromRegisterMiddleware` to the `MIDDLEWARE` settings:

    ```python
    MIDDLEWARE = [
        ...
        'tom_common.middleware.AuthStrategyMiddleware',
        'tom_registration.middleware.RedirectAuthenticatedUsersFromRegisterMiddleware',
    ]
    ```
 
 3. If you're using approval registration and you would like a message informing the user that their account is pending approval if they try to log in prior to approval, you'll need to make the following changes:

     First, in your `settings.py`, set the first item of your `AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS`:

     ```python
     AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
         'django.contrib.auth.backends.AllowAllUsersModelBackend',
         'guardian.backends.ObjectPermissionBackend'
     )
     ```

     Then, change the value of `REGISTRATION_AUTHENTICATION_BACKEND` in the `TOM_REGISTRATION` setting that was just created:

     ```python
     TOM_REGISTRATION = {
         'REGISTRATION_AUTHENTICATION_BACKEND': 'django.contrib.auth.backends.AllowAllUsersModelBackend`,
         ...
     }
     ```

## Email

In the approval required registration flow, there is available behavior to send basic emails notifying administrators of a registration request, and notifying users of registration approval. Administrators are determined by the [Django MANAGERS setting](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/settings/#managers). Email behavior can be enabled or disabled with `SEND_APPROVAL_EMAILS`.

The configuration of an email backend is a topic covered in depth by the [Django docs](http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/email/#smtp-backend). There are a number of required settings that will need to be added.

In the future, `tom_registration` will provide more configurable behavior upon user registration/approval.

## Running the tests

In order to run the tests, run the following in your virtualenv:

`python manage.py test`
